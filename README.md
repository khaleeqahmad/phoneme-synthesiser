# phoneme-synthesiser

This is a simple text-to-speech synthesiser which relies on basic speech phonemes from the [Carnegie Mellon University pronouncing dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict). 
The system manipulates wav files as NumPy arrays and is able to successfully normalise standard dates and numbers when given in text.

My implementation is in Synth.py

Based on Coursework for Computer Programming for Speech and Language Processing, University of Edinburgh.
